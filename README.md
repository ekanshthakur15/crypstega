# Overview

The Secure File Encryption System is a robust and user-friendly solution designed to allow users to send, receive, and store files in a highly secure and encrypted manner. This system employs a unique approach where a partial key, recipient's username, and a safe code are embedded in an image file. The image is then sent to the recipient's email address. To decrypt the file, the recipient needs to enter the image and the safe code provided by the sender.

# Features

**End-to-End Encryption:** All files are encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm, ensuring the confidentiality of the data during transmission and storage.
**Partial Key in Image:** A portion of the encryption key is embedded in an image file, adding an extra layer of security to the encryption process.
**Secure Email Transmission:** The encrypted image file is sent to the recipient's email address, ensuring a secure and private delivery of the encryption key.
**User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides an intuitive and easy-to-use interface, allowing users to seamlessly encrypt, send, receive, and decrypt files without a steep learning curve.

# Usage

**Encryption**
Open the Secure File Encryption System application.
Select the file you want to encrypt.
Choose an image file that will contain the partial key, recipient's username, and a safe code.
Enter the recipient's username and a secure code.
Click "Encrypt" to generate the encrypted file.
Sending Encrypted File
The system will automatically send an email to the recipient with the encrypted image file attached.
The recipient will receive an email containing instructions on how to decrypt the file.
**Decryption**
Open the Secure File Encryption System application.
Select the encrypted image file received via email.
Enter the safe code provided by the sender.
Click "Decrypt" to retrieve the original file.

**Security Considerations**

Encryption Algorithm: Ensure that the chosen encryption algorithm is secure and up-to-date.
Safe Code: Encourage users to choose strong and unique safe codes to enhance the overall security of the system.
Email Security: Emphasize the importance of securing email accounts to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted files.
